# AdaFVF.jl

This is a Flux compatible implementation of the AdaFVF, a HAFVF version of the Adam optimiser. 

In short, the AdaFVF will achieve some hierarchical Bayesian inference about the gradient distribution, which allows for an data-driven adaptation of the moments $\beta$1 and $\beta$2.

This is a development package, without guarantee of any kind. 

Installation
------------
This is an unregistered package. 

To install it, first clone the git repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vmoens/AdaFVF.jl/
$ cd AdaFVF.jl
```

Checkout to the `dev` branch.
```
$ git checkout dev
```

To use locally, activate and instantiate:
```
$ julia
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> activate .
(AdaFVF) pkg> instantiate
```

Now you can add this project to your register. From any folder, run
``
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> /path/to/my/AdaFVF.jl
```

Usage
-----
First load the package
```
julia> using AdaFVF
```
Given a `Flux.jl` model `MyModel`, get the parameters and create an optimiser:
```
julia> P = params(MyModel)
julia> adafvf = Adafvf(P)
```

Now `adafvf` is an optimiser object associated with a method for updating the gradient. The following code update the parameters of the model:
```
julia> loss = MyModel(some_data)
julia> Flux.Tracker.back!(loss)
julia> adafvf()
```


Discosure
---------

The package is not yet formatted for Float32 real numbers: caution should be taken when used for GPU optimisation.
